# Pride! for the terminal

A Rust utility to display pride flags in the terminal.

**This project is under heavy construction! It is subject to major structural and
architectural changes. There are no issues with functionality, but I will continue
to make major changes and refactors until the main roadmap is complete.**

Currently supports a variety of stripe flags.

## Dependencies

Complex renderers often use [Powerline's slant](https://github.com/ryanoasis/powerline-extra-symbols)
symbols, and therefore require use of a Powerline font, such as [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).

## Libraries

- [pico-args](https://crates.io/crates/pico-args)
- [termion](https://crates.io/crates/termion)
