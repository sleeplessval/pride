# Pride! for the terminal

A Rust utility to display pride flags in the terminal.

**This project is under heavy construction! It is subject to major structural and
architectural changes. There are no issues with functionality, but I am not
satisfied with the current state of the project. The software is usable, but I will
continue to refer to it as pre-release until I am happy with it.**

Currently supports a variety of stripe flags.

## Variant Flag Branch

This branch adds flag variants. Currently, it adds two for the rainbow pride flag:
- Gilbert Baker/Sex and Magic: original 1978 eight-color rainbow flag
- Philadelphia: 2017 rainbow flag with black and brown stripes
