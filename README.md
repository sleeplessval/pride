# Pride! for the terminal

A Rust utility to display pride flags in the terminal.

**This project is under heavy construction! It is subject to major structural and
architectural changes. There are no issues with functionality, but I am not
satisfied with the current state of the project. The software is usable, but I will
continue to refer to it as pre-release until I am happy with it.**

Currently supports a variety of stripe flags.

Under Construction features:
- [Variant Flags](https://git.vwolfe.io/valerie/pride/src/branch/variant)
- ["Complex" Flags](https://git.vwolfe.io/valerie/pride/src/branch/complex)
