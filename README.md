# Pride! for the terminal

A Rust utility to display pride flags in the terminal.

**This project is under heavy construction! It is subject to major structural and
architectural changes. There are no issues with functionality, but I will continue
to make major changes and refactors until the main roadmap is complete.**

Currently supports a variety of stripe flags.

Under Construction features:
- ["Complex" Flags](https://git.vwolfe.io/valerie/pride/src/branch/complex)
